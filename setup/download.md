# Download

If you already have a Java JRE installed level 1.7 or higher \(and set in your environment variables\), you can [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the non-JRE version for your Operating System. If you don't have a JRE installed or aren't sure, we would recommend you to [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the version with a JRE included. Below you will find the way to get the latest stable and bleeding edge releases. Please also note that in our [installation](installation.md) page, you will find detailed information on how to install CommandBox with modern Operating System package managers as well.

> **Info** The non-JRE versions are all around 40MB in size, while the embedded JRE versions will go up to 90MB in size.

## Stable Release

Stable versions of CommandBox can be downloaded from the downloads section of our product page. [http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox\#download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download)

## Bleeding Edge

We use a Jenkins integration server to automate our builds. You can download a bleeding-edge version of CommandBox directly from our integration server here: [https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/\#/ortussolutions/commandbox/](https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/#/ortussolutions/commandbox/)

> **Info** Keep in mind, bleeding edge builds may contain experimental features that are likely to change or bugs.

## Auto Updates

Another way to get the bleeding edge version of CommandBox is to install the stable version and run our `upgrade` command using the **latest** flag. [Upgrade API docs](http://apidocs.ortussolutions.com/commandbox/current/index.html?commandbox/system/modules/system-commands/commands/upgrade.html).

```bash
upgrade --latest
```

> **Info** Please note that the upgrade command will not update the main CommandBox binary. If there are major updates or you get a message about updating the binary, you will need to download the latest binary and re-install it.
